#### Programmatic Approach
* Set requirements for minimum viable product
* Created wireframes
* Created a database to store all relevent information
* Created initial RESTful routes required for usage
* Wrote the code to access the LOTR api and store relevant information in my database
* Created a page for global chat using the socket.io node module
* Added a dropdown search box to filter through character quotes
* Created additional routes and made necessary changes to my socket code to allow for multiple chat rooms
* Add the ability to upload of picture of your character using cloudinary
* Updated the chat to include the picture of the characters
* Styled the site and added some quality of life changes

#### MVP:
* Utilize the LOTR api to access information about LOTR characters
* Build a database that will link a user to a specific character and give them access to the quotes of that character
* Create specific rooms
* Build a page that utilizes socket.io to create a global chat
* Create a list of buttons for each quote of a given character(and user) that when clicked will put the quote into the global chat
* Create a profile page that will have information about the character the user is role playing as

#### Stretch Goals:
* Allow users to change their character
* Create a database of gifs that feature the quotes of a given character and allow users to share these gif in the global chat
* Allow a user to create a private chat with another user (big stretch)
* Build a database that has the quotes of 10 Star Wars character
* Utilize the Star Wars api to access information about the 10 Star Wars characters
